                    Cornwall has a temperate Oceanic climate and as a result of its southerly latitude and the
                    influence of the Gulf Stream has the mildest and sunniest climate in the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>The average annual temperature in Cornwall ranges from 11.6 °C (53 °F) on
                    the Isles of Scilly to 9.8 °C (52 °F) in the central uplands. Winters are amongst the
                    warmest and shortest in the country due to the southerly latitude and moderating effects
                    of the warm ocean currents. The resultant early spring and long growing season means
                    that Cornwall is home to an abundant array of quality produce, and also that we start to
                    see the early crops of vegetables and flowers before the rest of the country.</p>
                <p> Frost and snow are very rare. The surrounding sea and its
                    southwesterly position mean that Cornwall's weather is relatively changeable.<br />
                </p>
                <p>Cornwall is one of the sunniest areas in the UK, with over 1541
                    hours of sunshine per year, with the highest average of 7.6 hours of sunshine
                    per day in July. The moist, mild air coming from the south west brings higher
                    amounts of rainfall than in eastern Great Britain, at 1051 to 1290 mm (41.4 to
                    50.8 in) per year, however not as much as in more northern areas of the west
                    coast. This rain along with all that lovely sun helps to make our county so
                    green and beautiful.</p>
                <p> The Gulf Stream, bringing warm air from the Caribbean
                    north-east toward Europe, makes Cornwall's weather distinctly milder than
                    other places in the world at the same latitude, such as Newfoundland. Also
                    due to the Gulf Stream, Cornwall has the UK's only area of sub-tropical
                    climate. This sub-tropical nature has resulted in a number of botanical
                    gardens, such as <a href="http://www.trebahgarden.co.uk/" target="_blank"
                        title="Link to Trebah Gardens - Opens a new window.">Trebah</a> and the
                    Lost Gardens of <a href="http://www.heligan.com/" target="_blank"
                        title="Link to Heligan - opens in new window.">Heligan</a>.</p>
                <p>Pendennis Point in Falmouth is the warmest place on
                    mainland Great Britain, with an average temperature of 11.4°C (52.5°F).
                    Extreme temperatures in Cornwall are particularly rare.

            <h3>Emergency Services</h3>
            <p>
                If you realise you have come away without your usual medication, this can usually be easily
                sorted by ringing your home GP and asking them to fax a prescription to one of the pharmacies in
                Liskeard (details below).
                Cornwall runs a ‘111 first’ scheme. Please ring 111 and they will book you into the right place.
                This could be a local GP, Liskeard or Plymouth minor injuries or direct you to A&E.
            </p>
            <strong>Hospital</strong> – Liskeard Community Hospital has a minor injuries unit and can be found
            on Clemo Road, Liskeard.
            The nearest main hospital with A&E; is Derriford in Plymouth, signed from the A38.</br></br>
            <strong>Doctors</strong> – Rosedean Surgery, Dean Street, Liskeard – 01579 343915 OR Oaktree
            Surgery, Clemo Road, Liskeard– 01579 335320. Both numbers will take you through directly to an
            out-of-hours service after 6pm or at weekends.</br></br>
            <strong>Police</strong> – Liskeard – 01579 342351</br></br>
            <strong>Pharmacy</strong> – there is a Boots in Bay Tree Hill, Liskeard (tel. 01579 343183 fax.
            01579 343473) and there is also an independent pharmacy called Day Lewis in Pike Street, Liskeard
            (tel. 01579 342225 fax. 01579 344185).</br> Both doctors’ surgeries have a dispensary which should
            dispense for any prescriptions given to you by one of their doctors as you are staying over 1 mile
            from the nearest pharmacy.</br>
            Saltash Pharmacy is open 7am to 11pm if you need something outside normal opening hours, invaluable
            if you receive a prescription from the out of hours GP surgery: 6 Regal Court, Unit 6, Off Fore

                <h3>Grocery shopping</h3>
                The nearest shop is the Aladdin’s Cave that is the Spar in Menheniot, about half a mile away. It’s a
                short drive or a 10–15 minute, hilly walk for a moderately fit person. You can walk down the lane to
                the village or take a short cut by turning left at the corner of the barns and following the
                footpath signs which will take you out opposite the white house named Polpinka. The Spar sells
                general groceries (including nappies and baby wipes) as well as some local produce both fresh and
                frozen. It also contains a Post Office and a hot food takeaway (tel. 01579 342266). The Spar is open
                7.30am to 10pm Monday to Saturday and 9am to 9pm on Sundays.</br></br>
                In Liskeard (2.5 miles) there is a Morrisons Supermarket and petrol station just off the A38.</br>
                There is an Aldi Supermarket just further on near the hospital.</br> In the centre of the town there
                are two bakeries, a butcher, greengrocer, health food shop, newsagent, post office, several cafes,
                pubs and takeaways. Pengelly’s, the fishmonger mentioned on Rick Stein’s Food Heroes, who sell fish
                caught by Looe fishermen, can be found in Fore Street open Thursday and Friday 9.15 to 4.</br>
                There is an Asda in Bodmin, Tesco in Callington and Waitrose and Lidl in Saltash. The nearest
                Sainsbury’s is in Plymouth. Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose will deliver internet shopping
                orders to Tregrill.</br>
                We also recommend the farmer’s market held at Kernow Mills (at Trerulefoot on the A38) held on a
                Thursday, Friday and Saturday, Trevallicks Farm Shop and Tea Room on the B3254 heading towards
                Launceston from Liskeard, just past Pensilva the butcher Paul Bray in Tideford. The fish and farm
                shops in Looe are also great.</br>

                <h3>Play area</h3>
                Menheniot also has a children’s play area – to find this take the road that runs in front of the
                Spar, this road curves round the back of some converted almshouses, you will pass a small
                hairdresser’s on the left, take the next left turn and follow this road. Shortly on the left you
                will see some public toilets and on the right the village hall. The play area and playing fields are
                directly after the village hall. There is parking in front of the play area or a small free car park
                can be used by taking the next left turn, turning left again and proceeding until the end of the
                road. If you cross the playing field and go around the cricket pavilion and cross the cricket field
                you will find there is also a willow maze for children to play in.
